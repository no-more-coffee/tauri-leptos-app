# Simplest music player built with Tauri+Leptos

This project is a desktop app built with web-based frameworks Tauri and Leptos. 
The goal is to create a simple and lightweight music player that can be used on any major desktop platform.

Although I have limited time to work on this project, I have managed to implement the core functionality.

## Features

- Parse exported iTunes library from unconventional XML.
- Play mp3 files using browsers `<audio>` tag.
